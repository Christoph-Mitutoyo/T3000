The change from 32 to 64 bit caused an error in a software product of Mitutoyo. \newline
This thesis analyzes the cause of the error and evaluates tools which can potentially detect similar errors. \newline
The evaluated tools include: PCLint-Plus, Cppcheck, UBSan and PVS-Studio. All of these tools can detect similar errors, with Cppcheck being the overall winner of the comparison.
